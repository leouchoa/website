        <h1>Exploring Image Generation Techniques with A.I.</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome back to our series on generating images with artificial
          intelligence. In Part 02, we'll explore some of the techniques and
          tools used in image generation with A.I.
        </p>
        <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most popular techniques for image generation is Generative
          Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs consist of two neural networks, the
          generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a
          competitive setting.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "GANs have been used to create incredibly realistic images,
          indistinguishable from photographs."
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</h3>
        <p>
          Another commonly used technique is Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
          VAEs learn a low-dimensional representation of input data and generate
          new samples by sampling from this learned distribution.
        </p>
